/**
 * Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This
 * can later be changed with {transferOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the owner.

 Block and Transaction Properties

    block.blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32): hash of the given block - only works for 256 most recent blocks excluding current
    block.coinbase (address): current block minerâ€™s address
    block.difficulty (uint): current block difficulty
    block.gaslimit (uint): current block gaslimit
    block.number (uint): current block number
    block.timestamp (uint): current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch
    gasleft() returns (uint256): remaining gas
    msg.data (bytes): complete calldata
    msg.sender (address): sender of the message (current call)
    msg.sig (bytes4): first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)
    msg.value (uint): number of wei sent with the message
    now (uint): current block timestamp (alias for block.timestamp)
    tx.gasprice (uint): gas price of the transaction
    tx.origin (address): sender of the transaction (full call chain)

Address Related

<address>.balance (uint256):
    balance of the Address in Wei
<address>.transfer(uint256 amount):
    send given amount of Wei to Address, throws on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
<address>.send(uint256 amount) returns (bool):
    send given amount of Wei to Address, returns false on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
<address>.call(...) returns (bool):
    issue low-level CALL, returns false on failure, forwards all available gas, adjustable
<address>.callcode(...) returns (bool):
    issue low-level CALLCODE, returns false on failure, forwards all available gas, adjustable
<address>.delegatecall(...) returns (bool):
    issue low-level DELEGATECALL, returns false on failure, forwards all available gas, adjustable

For more information, see the section on Address.
There are some dangers in using send: The transfer fails if the call stack depth is at 1024 (this can 
always be forced by the caller) and it also fails if the recipient runs out of gas. So in order to make 
safe Ether transfers, always check the return value of send, use transfer or even better: Use a pattern 
where the recipient withdraws the money.
